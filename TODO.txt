Consider changing all Date-objects to DateTime instead
Consider using UTC datetimes in the backend as well as the db, only converting for display purposes
Consider adding a timezone setting for users that defaults to the server's location (GMT+1)
The save-method in each model MUST persist ALL data to the db!!!
