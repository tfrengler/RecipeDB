<p><strong>ABOUT RESPONSIVE DESIGN:</strong></p>
<p>Remembering the struggles I had with the wedding website I have decided already NOT to make this thing mobile friendly. At best it'll work for tablet-sized screens and up. Being just one guy and someone who is less interested in layout and design than I am in the backend this just isn't gonna happen. Also: designing for mobiles means designing for tall and narrow,&nbsp;which in my mind really restricts what you can do at certain points.</p>
<p>I primarily develop (and therefore test) this program against Chrome. It&nbsp;<em>should&nbsp;</em>work for Firefox, IE (11), Microsoft Edge and Safari but I have not focus tested it on those browsers. Let me know if something comes up that appears to break, either functionally or in terms of layout.</p>
<p><strong>LAYOUT AND DESIGN:</strong></p>
<p>I'm not 100% happy with the layout/design yet, so what you see may not be final. I am also not happy with how navigation feels (mostly from a backend&nbsp;perspective). That means I ended up hacking a few things towards the end because I aim at going back at re-designing it later on once I figure out a good way of doing it.</p>
<p><strong>OKAY, BUT WHAT'S NEXT?</strong></p>
<p>My plan for the next feature implementation&nbsp;are&nbsp;pictures, for the recipe and in the recipe instructions. I have little to no experience with file uploads and images so I need to do some proper research first. For now I am mostly interested in user experience feedback and nailing the core experience of adding and editing recipes.</p>
